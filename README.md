This are projects that I have finished from my AI Club

The 8QueensWorking2 is a script that solves the 8 queens problem.
  - First it will generate random starting boards then do random mutations till it finds a solution
  - The solutions are given in a array of 8 integers
      - The index is the column location of the queen and the value is the row locations of the queen
      
The face mask detection program
  - This program first noramlizes all the images in the training set and also picks data fro the training set to take out and test later
  - Then creates a neural network model using tensorflow and fits and test the model.
  - The system will output the accuracy of the test for the model and loss
  - Future upgrades:
    - Have the program find face then see if there is a mask or not
    - Implement computer camera to detect face.
